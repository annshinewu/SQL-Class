4/13 We worked on task 3-5. The last task was to choose and create our own function and then demo it in front of the class. For my function, I created a function that calculates the amount a teacher should curve based on Ms. Liu's curving system. First, you eliminate all the scores below 60. Then, you average the rest of the scores. The amount you should curve will be the amount needed to reach 85 with the averaged number.
